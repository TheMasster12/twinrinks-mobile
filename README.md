# Twin Rinks Mobile Apps

>Mobile applications for Twin Rinks Adult Hockey on the Android and iOS platforms. 

[View the Project Website](http://mass.github.io/twinrinks-mobile/)

These apps were designed to help Twin Rinks Adult Hockey players keep track of their game schedules. The apps are relatively simple, but get the job done! If you have a good idea for the apps, send me an email at amass1212@gmail.com or, better yet, implement the feature! 

## Contributing
There are plenty of things which can be improved upon for this application. If you have an idea for a new feature, fork the repo and submit a pull request!

In addition, the iOS version of the app is in need of some serious work. Specifically, it needs to have the automatic data fetching feature ported over from android as `ScheduleData.txt` will no longer be maintained.

When submitting pull requests, please try to maintain the current code style.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Boris Dubinsky](http://www.github.com/dubi13) for adding multiple features to the Android app, including calendar integration, automatic data fetching, and database storage.
