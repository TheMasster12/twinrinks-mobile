# Twin Rinks Mobile Apps

Mobile applications for Twin Rinks Adult Hockey on the Android and iOS platforms. 

Both apps are currently released on the market, but could use improvement. I greatly appreciate any help in improving either application.

Android code is located in the `android` folder, and iOS code in the `iOS` folder of this repository. Instructions for getting set up with each project can be found in those folders' `README` files.

## Contributing
The most beneficial feature which needs to be added right now is automatic loading of game data straight from the Twin Rinks Website. This is tricky, however, as the format of the data on the Twin Rinks website is not always consistent. If you can find a good way to do it, please let me know or better yet, submit at pull request!

## Schedule Data
**Formatting for ScheduleData.txt:**

`Date,DayOfWeek,Rink,StartTime,EndTime,League,HomeTeam,AwayTeam;`
  
**Example:**
   
`02/25/13,MO,RED,10:20P,11:50P,Platinum,GREY,GOLD;`

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Boris Dubinsky](http://www.github.com/dubi13) for adding the Android calendar integration feature.
